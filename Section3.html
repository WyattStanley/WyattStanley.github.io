                            </p>The objective of this project is to update the current base of knowledge surrounding Oregon’s interest in salmon population and habitat restoration along their coast. The goal of collecting this information is to determine Oregon’s willingness to engage in restoration, volunteer efforts, and donation to restoration efforts. Another objective of this project is to collect information on Oregon’s understanding and interest in the endangered south resident killer whale that lives off their coast. Washington has made salmon habitat restoration efforts due to the culturally and historically significant north resident killer whales who requires a sufficient salmon population in the Puget Sound to survive. Understanding the cultural significance and importance of killer whales to Oregon residence could aid in salmon habitat protection strategies similar to Washingtons. Restoration and protection strategies could allow for the promotion of salmon population which leads to the increase the south resident killer whale populations. This project will consider how urbanization and new construction in proximity to salmon habitat can have detrimental effects on not only the habitat itself which hosts countless ecosystems, other fish and reliant species, but also effects other animals higher up the food chain. It will also consider why some geographic locations, such as Washington state, may have an advantage when it comes to salmon habitat restoration based on specific species and landscapes being affected. With the goal of collecting information on Oregon’s interest in salmon and south resident whale restoration, this project aims to conduct a survey to collect up to date beliefs from a sample living in Seaside, OR.

Restoring and protecting current habitat could be beneficial for not only salmon populations but the countless other fish, insects, animals, and plants that rely on healthy rivers and shores. This could promote cleaner rivers and healthier ecosystems in Oregon. Raising awareness around salmon habitat could also aid in the reduction of urbanization of shorelines and wetlands, it could bring awareness to the pollution of rivers, and could bring awareness to global warming that is heating rivers beyond survivable temperatures. Raising salmon populations in Oregon would also increase south resident killer whale populations who eat primarily salmon throughout the year. This project could increase awareness around south resident killer whale population restoration efforts which could aid in the increase of their population.

                            </p>Chinook salmon, a once plentiful species in the Pacific Northwest, occupied the Puget Sound and Columbia River (Hanson, 2021). Since the 1970’s, these salmon populations of the Northeastern Pacific have experienced a decline in abundance and productivity. (Couture, 2022). Many factors aid to this decline, including global warming, which has heated British Columbias Fraser River ~1.8 degrees F from 1953 to 1998, killing 50% of that river’s sockeye salmon (Olsen, 2022). Other factors include dams, which block salmon migration, Puget Sound’s toxicity from “pulp, paper mills, oil refineries, ports, boatyards, and storm-water runoff” (Olsen, 2022, p. 3), and degradation of freshwater habitats (Couture, 2022). Specific environmental changes that effect habitat include land cover construction such as “roads, buildings, parking lots and other impervious surfaces has been associated with poor habitat conditions for salmon” (Bartz, 2015, p. 2). Due to these changes, half the Chinook salmon in British Columbia have a spawning abundance so low that they are not likely to hit the biological benchmark to sustain those populations.  In the USA, most Chinook salmon coming from the Columbia and Sacramento Rivers are listed as endangered or threatened under the Endangered Species Act. (Couture, 2022).

                            </p>The decline of salmon habitat not only effects the Chinook population in the Pacific Northwest, but it also effects north resident killer whales living in the Puget Sound. Killer whales living in the Puget Sound have a strong ecological link with direct evidence stating that north resident killer whale group size directly correlates to Chinook salmon abundance (Williams, 2011). Without sufficient abundance in Washington and British Columbia, population recovery for these whales is impossible (Hanson, 2021). This is because Chinook salmon are an important source of food for killer whales throughout the year. In the fall, salmon makes up 50% of killer whale diets. In winter to early spring, this percent increases to 70-80%. In the spring, salmon makes up 100% of north resident killer whales when abundant (Hanson, 2021). In the mid-1990s, when wild chinook population declined, there was a population decrease in north resident killer whales from 219 in 1995 to 202 in 2001 (Olsen, 2006). This correlation becomes important when considering habitat and salmon conservation.

                            <h2>The Importance of an Icon:</h2>
                            </p>“Seeing killer whales ply the waters of Washington state's Puget Sound has long been a great thrill for Seattle-area residents. No other U.S. urban community can boast of resident orcas a few miles from downtown. Whale watching there is a multi-million-dollar tourist draw. As one orca expert puts it, ‘Everybody wants a kiss from a killer whale’” (Olsen, 2006, p. 1).  
                            Killer whales are a cultural and historical icon to the Pacific Northwest, living together with indigenous people in the Puget Sound for 5000 years (EPA, 2023). No other community in the U.S. has the Puget Sound, a specific landscape to Washington that is ideal for the north resident killer whales. Without historically abundant food sources there has been a decline in killer whale populations. “In order to save our orcas, we need to save the salmon runs that sustain them” (Olsen, 2021, p. 3). The orcas in the Pacific Northwest sparked the need for change which brought attention to the declining Chinook population in the Pacific Northwest. People cared because “Everyone wants a kiss from a killer whale”. Due to changes in killer whale population, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA, 2023) created the Puget Sound Nearshore Habitat Conservation Calculator. The calculator is an online tool that draws on the latest habitat research to help offset the impacts on species such as the regions salmon and steelhead (NOAA, 2023). This tool is used by environmental specialists to assess the environmental impact of wetland construction on shorelines in the Puget Sound region, based on the impact, a credit or debit is assigned that can be paid off or can be settled through environmental conservation that offsets the damage done. Since the north resident killer whale population is declining throughout the Puget Sound, this tool only exists for nearshore Puget Sound conservation.

                            <h2>Salmon Restoration in Oregon:</h2>
                            </p>In Oregon State, salmon populations are facing a similar fate. There is steady decline to populations due to climate change, human activity, and costal development. (Fema, 2009). These changes to the environment are putting these fish and the Oregon nearshore habitats at risk without any expectation that it will be returned to predeveloped condition (Meengs, 2005). Although the salmon population is steadily declining, Oregon residents desire to fight this problem is lessening. A study done in Oregon by Claire A. Montgomery assessed the importance Oregon residence place on salmon recovery and their willingness to pay for salmon recovery efforts. This study was assessed biennially between 1996 and 2002 through a population study. They found that over this period, people became less interested and less willing to pay for recovery (Montgomery, 2006). If that trend has continued, salmon habitat and population recovery may be impossible to achieve through public aid and activism. If Oregon’s population has no desire to aid in restoration than strategies such as bringing awareness toward the importance of salmon and south resident killer population restoration becomes important. In this case, it may be necessary to find aid and donations outside of the state of Oregon, from people who may care more about restoration work. Although the study states a decrease in public desire to pay for restoration, this study is over 20 years old. A new generation may be more open to the possibility of paying for restoration. They may be more empathetic toward the recovery of salmon habitat, population, and the recovery efforts for the south resident killer whale. If Oregon’s younger population is more willing to pay or volunteer for recovery, than a different strategy may be taken. Focusing on gaining aid through Oregon residents may be a more feasible option. Without an up-to-date survey of public opinion, it would be much more difficult to follow through with restoration effort and it would be harder to know who is in support of restoration.

                            <h2>Can Oregon Learn to Love their Orcas:</h2>
                            </p>Similarly to the north resident killer whales in Washington whose population is shrinking in its territories stretching from Alaska to Washington, Oregon has its own local southern resident killer whales who’s population is also in decline. (Baumhardt, 2023). South resident killer whales occupy coastal regions from Oregon to California and have specific coastal regions they use to hunt and areas they use as passage. In Oregon, the most active feeding zone is between the Oregon and Washington boarder at the head of the Columbia River and stretches down to Cape Meares, Oregon. The rest of the Oregon coast south of Cape Meres is used as passage for south resident killer whales till they reach their next feeding zone between the north California boarder and Cape Mendocino California (NMFS, 2021, p. 41682). Similarly, to Washington, Oregon has a declining salmon habitat and a declining resident killer whale population. Due to Washingtons historic and culturally significant relationship with killer whale and Chinook Salmon, there is a desire to save these animals. Though Oregon is facing similar issue, their cultural relationship with salmon and killer whales is less clear, in fact, there desire to aid in their restoration of salmon habitat may be shrinking (Montgomery, 2006).  If Oregon’s desire to save salmon continues to shrink, there may be no hope for the salmon. Do Oregon residents feel that killer whales are culturally important or in deserve aid in the restoration of their species? If so, the ecological link between salmon and killer whales could allow for the restoration of both species in order to save the south resident killer whale. “In order to save our orcas, we need to save the salmon runs that sustain them” (Olsen, 2021, p. 3).  If Oregon residents continue to turn a blind eye to salmon restoration, putting the killer whale in the spotlight may allow restoration efforts to save them both. First, we must determine the current stance Oregon residence take in regard to both killer whale and salmon population restoration. My research question for this project is: Do Seaside, Oregon residents recognize the importance of salmon habitat restoration and south resident killer whale population restoration, are they willing to pay or volunteer to aid this cause, and do they recognize the Southern Killer Whale as a culturally significant species?

                            </p>The purpose of this research is to examine the gap in knowledge surrounding Seaside, Oregon’s willingness and interest to aid in the restoration of salmon habitat, willingness to pay for the restoration, and to understand if the presence of killer whales in the area can become iconic to the area in similar ways to Washington States Puget Sound Orcas. Research similar to this have not been conducted in over 20 years, updating this information could aid restoration strategies through public aid. Public interest and financial aid could lead to the restoration of salmon habitat in Oregon which could aid in population growth for both salmon and south resident killer whales living off the Oregon coast. Both of these species are endangered, growing their populations is important for their survival. 
                            The relationship between coastal development and its profound impact on salmon habitat and populations extend throughout the Pacific Northwest. These impacts effect the salmon populations in both Washington and Oregon equally. Due to the predator-prey relationship between north resident killer whales and salmon, the decline of salmon populations in the PNW have directly impacted the population of these killer whales. Due to the historic and cultural significance of these whales in the Puget Sound, Washington has taken steps to protect the Puget Sound nearshore salmon habitat through a NOAA nearshore calculator that holds developers responsible to pay for equal restoration based on changes made to the shoreline, this tool is only available in nearshore habitats in the Puget Sound. 
                            A study conducted in Oregon from 1996 to 2006 found that Oregon residents are losing interest in the declining salmon population (Montgomery, 2006). Without the desire to save the population of a well-known cultural icon such as the northern resident killer whale in Washington, there is not as much public incentive to aid in the restoration of these salmon. The purpose of this project is to collect up to date research on Oregon and its resident’s interest in the restoration of salmon habitat and to gauge Oregon empathy towards the south resident killer whale population living of their coast. To obtain the best sample, this study will survey Seaside, Oregon, the most populated coastal city between the Columbia River and Cape Meares Oregon, the south resident killer whale Oregon feeding ground. This will give the best odds for determining whether coastal residents living in proximity to a major salmon run and historic Orca feeding grounds will have any interest in restoration. Taking these steps to determine if there is interest in restoration could aid in the implementation of salmon habitat protection tools in Oregon.

                            </p>The survey research in this study will involve a structured questionnaires to gather comprehensive data from the residents of Seaside, Oregon. This approach will collect quantitative data which will provide a deeper understanding of public attitudes and perceptions toward salmon conservation.
                            The questionnaire will be formatted to collect a representative percent of Seaside in an effective manner. These questionnaires will consist of closed-ended questions with predefined response options. Questions will be asked to assess residents' recognition of the importance of salmon conservation, their willingness to support recovery efforts, there interest in killer whale conservation, and their demographic information. The questionnaires will be distributed to a random sample of Seaside residents, ensuring representation across different demographics.

                            </p>The unit of analysis is Oregon State. The goal of this project is to determine Oregon residence beliefs about the importance of salmon habitat restoration and protection and south resident killer whale population restoration. Understanding their beliefs is important to the restoration strategies that could be implemented.
                            The unit of observation for this project is Seaside Oregon. This is the sample of Oregon chosen to represent Oregon as a whole. This is because they are close to the shore and the Columbia River, areas that need to be improved through this project to aid in the restoration of these animals.

A random sampling strategy involves selecting residents of Seaside at random to ensure an equal distribution. This ensures that the sample will reflect the diversity of the Seaside population across different demographics, such as age, gender, income, education, and geographic location within the community.
